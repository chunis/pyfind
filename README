PyFind is a very simple tool for search files under a certain directory,
write in Python/tkInter, and released under GPLv3.

After the files are showed in the result table, you can open it, or copy
or move it to somewhere else, or delete it. PyFind can find Chinese name
files, too.

In fact, this tool is the precursor of a few similar tools: NPyFind,
spyfind and bookmate, all write in WxPython instead of tkInter.

Note: until today(2015-05-18), this project is far from complete, and very
likely won't be continued. All functions should be found in bookmate. This
code exists just for keeping its development history, and as an (ugly)
reference code base.
