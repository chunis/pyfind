**PyFind** is a very simple tool for search files under a certain directory,
write in Python/tkInter, and released under GPLv3.

After the files are showed in the result table, you can open it, or copy
or move it to somewhere else, or delete it. PyFind can find Chinese name
files, too.

In fact, this tool is the precursor of a few similar tools:
**[NPyFind](https://github.com/chunis/npyfind)**,
**[SPyFind](https://github.com/chunis/spyfind)** and
**[BookMate](https://github.com/chunis/bookmate)**,
all write in WxPython instead of tkInter.

**Note: this project is far from complete, and very likely won't be
continued.** All functions should be found in **bookmate**. This code exists
just for keeping its development history, and as an (ugly) reference code base.
